"""Resolve the app actually running in the active terminal window.

The compositor reports a terminal's appId (e.g. "foot"), but for screen
time we want the process running inside it (e.g. "opencode", "btop").
Given the terminal's pid, this walks /proc to find the terminal's pty and
then reports the process group leader currently in the foreground of that
tty — the standard notion of "the app the terminal is running".

Results are canonicalized: a browser launched from a terminal (or one of
its subprocesses) reports the browser's screen-time app name, never the
binary or an internal worker (zen-bin / Web Content / forkserver / …), so
screen time aggregates per browser.

Usage: resolve_app.py <terminal-pid>
Prints a single process name (basename of argv[0], falling back to comm)
and nothing on failure.
